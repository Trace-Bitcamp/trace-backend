Generate a markdown report summarizing a Parkinson's disease patient's medical history and assessment data in a consistent, medically helpful format. The report must include the following sections in this exact order, using the provided data:

1. **Patient Information**: Display the patient's name, age, sex, phone number, email, and the current date (provided as input).
2. **Patient Summary**: A brief overview of the patient's condition based on the provided notes, treatments, and assessment trends.
3. **Past Notes**: A list of all past clinical notes, each including the date and the note content.
4. **Past Treatments**: A list of all past treatments, each including the date, the treatment details, and the treatment provider.
5. **Assessment Trends**: An analysis of trends over time forTamb√©m the following metrics from each assessment:
   - Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
   - Model confidence of Parkinson's diagnosis
   - Mean relative tremor
   Summarize how these metrics have changed, noting any patterns or significant fluctuations, and interpret their clinical relevance.
6. **Recommendations**: Provide brief, specific advice on next steps for the patient's care, tailored to the trends and data provided. Recommendations should be practical, medically sound, and relevant to Parkinson's disease management.

**Input Data**:  
- Patient Name: {name}
- Patient Age: {age}
- Patient Sex: {sex}
- Patient Phone: {phone_number}
- Patient Email: {email}   
- Past notes: {notes}
- Past treatments: {treatments}
- Assessments: {assessments}

**Output Format**:  
Return the response strictly in markdown with the following structure:
