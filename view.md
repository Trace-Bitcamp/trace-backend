# Parkinson's Disease Patient Report

## Patient Information
- **Name**: John Doe
- **Age**: 65
- **Sex**: M
- **Phone Number**: +1234567890
- **Email**: john.d@gmail.com
- **Date**: 2023-11-03

## Patient Summary
John Doe is a 65-year-old male diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He initially presented with gait disturbances and tremors in the right hand, which have been managed with Levodopa, Amantadine and physical therapy. Recent data suggests some improvement in motor control, reflected in DTW scores, model confidence, and tremor measurements following medication adjustments and physical therapy. However, continued monitoring is warranted to optimize treatment and address ongoing stiffness.

## Past Notes
- **2023-10-01**: Patient shows mild tremors in the right hand.
- **2023-09-15**: Patient reports increased stiffness in the legs.
- **2023-08-20**: Patient's gait appears slightly shuffling.
- **2023-07-10**: Patient's medication regimen adjusted.
- **2023-06-05**: Patient reports improved sleep quality.

## Past Treatments
- **2023-10-01**: Increased dosage of Levodopa. (Provider: Dr. Smith)
- **2023-09-01**: Physical therapy sessions started. (Provider: Dr. Jones)
- **2023-08-15**: Prescribed Amantadine for tremor control. (Provider: Dr. Lee)
- **2023-07-01**: Initial diagnosis and treatment plan established. (Provider: Dr. Brown)

## Assessment Trends
The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) score has increased from 0.75 on 2023-07-01 to 0.85 on 2023-10-01, indicating a gradual improvement in motor coordination and movement patterns. Similarly, the model confidence of Parkinson's diagnosis has increased from 0.85 to 0.92 over the same period, reflecting increased certainty in the diagnosis, or more likely, improvement of certain metrics used in the model resulting in higher confidence, rather than a change in actual diagnosis. The mean relative tremor has decreased from 0.22 to 0.15, which signifies a reduction in tremor severity. These trends suggest a positive response to the medication adjustments and physical therapy. Continued monitoring is necessary to ascertain if the improvements are sustained or require further intervention.

## Recommendations
1. Continue current medication regimen (Levodopa and Amantadine) and physical therapy.
2. Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Smith in one month to reassess tremor severity and medication effectiveness, considering possible side effects of Levodopa at the current dosage.
3. Continue to monitor gait and stiffness levels during physical therapy sessions with Dr. Jones. Evaluate for potential adjustments to the physical therapy plan if stiffness persists.
